<!-- value={todo} onChange={(e) => settodo(e.target.value)} -->
 <!-- here  value is used to connect to the state and where as settodo is used to update the status if any event such as key pressed occurs it is
  catched by e and set the target value to the state. -->

  <!-- at first if the button is clicked then the data is lost so we need to handle the form submission and 
  prevent the default behavior. -->
  <!-- as user types the value is stored but for display it is after submiting what happens -->
